<h1>Beyond the Code</h1>
<p>
        I am a 32-year-old who enjoys the simple joys of lifeâ€”spending time with family and friends, playing video games, and watching a good comedy. 
        I have a passion for sports, both watching and playing, and I love animated shows that bring out a sense of nostalgia and fun.
        Originally from Venezuela, I appreciate good food, great company, and making the most out of every moment. 
        My dog is a big part of my life, always keeping things interesting and full of energy. 
        Whether it is a relaxing night watching a show or an active day outdoors, I enjoy finding a balance between fun and relaxation.
        I believe in working hard while also making time for the things that bring happiness. 
        Whether it is gaming, catching up with loved ones, or just enjoying a good laugh, I appreciate the little things that make life enjoyable.
